# Odin Recipe project 

this is a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

*The website wonâ€™t look very pretty* 
This project is just to build my HTML skills; 

**I will Revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS**.
